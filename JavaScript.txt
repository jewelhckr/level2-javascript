Objects are variables
- They contain a list of items
- Describe more about a particular  variable
- Properties and Methods
- Curly braces, squiggly brackets
- Key:value pair

Access
- dot notation
- bracket notation

Properties are what you use to describe that objects Features, Characteristics

Methods : What the objects can do

mytTable = {
    stands : 2,
    color : "white",
    shape : "rectangular"
}
